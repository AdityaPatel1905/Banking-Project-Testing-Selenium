# Banking-Project-Testing-Selenium

Step into our cutting-edge collaborative endeavor, where Selenium Web Driver and Python converge to automate testing for a demo banking website. I meticulously scrutinize nine critical modules, from New Customer to Edit Customer, ensuring flawless functionality. But I don't stop there. I am crafting a user-friendly menu-driven program, transforming testing into an intuitive experience. Every test execution is meticulously recorded, capturing actual results with precision. And with my Bug Tracker Report, transparency reigns supreme as I track and address every bug. Join me in redefining testing automation, where innovation and precision collide to set new standards in quality assurance.
